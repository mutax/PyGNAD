pygnad - PYthonGtkNetzwerkAuslastungsDing - shows network utilisation in a Tray Icon

written 2011 by Florian Streibelt.


Motivation
----------

I was not able to find a TrayIcon that shows me the Bandwith utilisation of network interfaces
in a lxpanel so I wrote my own. Besides I wanted to learn python :)



TODO
----

Allow command line to give a list of interfaces that should get summed.
